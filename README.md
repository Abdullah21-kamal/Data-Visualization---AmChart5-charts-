# Data-Visualization---AmChart5-charts-

* Project Name: Data Visualization Website with Amchart, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Flask
Overview
This project combines Data Science and Web Development concepts to create a dynamic website that reads data from a CSV file, processes it using Flask in Python, and presents interactive visualizations using Amchart, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Technologies Used: 
- Amchart: Amchart is a JavaScript charting library that allows for the creation of interactive and visually appealing charts. In this project, Amchart is used to build both a Pie Chart and a Bar Chart.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used to enhance interactivity and responsiveness on the client-side of web development. It plays a crucial role in updating and rendering the charts dynamically.

- HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure for the web page, including elements that embed the charts and define the layout.

- CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements and ensuring a visually appealing and consistent presentation of the website.

- Flask (Python): Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It is used to handle backend tasks, such as reading data from a CSV file, processing it, and serving it to the front end.

Project Structure:
- server.py: This is the main Flask application file. It contains the server-side logic, routes, and data processing.

- templates/: This directory contains HTML templates used by Flask to render pages dynamically.

- static/: The static directory stores static files, including CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

- Orders.csv: This CSV file that contains the data used for visualization.
